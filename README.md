# 03-readable-layout-starter

This example is intentionally “ugly”. Your job is to make it readable.

## Tasks (suggested order)

1) Add a baseline:
- sensible font stack
- `line-height`

2) Constrain line length:
- apply a `max-width` to the main content
- center it with `margin: 0 auto`
- add `padding`

3) Normalize spacing:
- remove surprise default margins (then add your own deliberately)

4) Add one responsive behavior:
- make the teaser cards become columns on wider screens
- keep them stacked on narrow screens

5) Make focus visible:
- add `:focus-visible` styles for links and inputs

## DevTools checklist

- Use Computed → Box Model to confirm margin/padding.
- Verify your `max-width` is applied to the intended container.
